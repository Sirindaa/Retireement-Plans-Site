		<h1>IRA Retirement Plan</h1>

		<h2>What is an IRA Retirement plan?</h2>
			<p>An Individual Retirement Account (IRA) is a type of savings account that is designed to help you save for retirement and offers many tax advantages. There are two different types of IRAs: Traditional and Roth IRAs.</p>
		<h2>Who is Eligible for an IRA Retirement plan?</h2>
			<p>Everyone!</p>
		<h2>How to open an IRA Account</h2>
			<p>To open an IRA, find a personal plan that fits your individual investment style. Itâ€™s important to know that application instructions vary based on the type of investing style you choose.</p>
		<h2>Pros to opening an IRA Account</h2>
			<p>
				Tax-deferred: These funds go into a tax-deferred retirement plan account and can be set up at any time
				<br>
				<br>
				Easy, cheap to start: plan holders set up their own IRAs.
				<br>
				<br>
				More flexible allocation: While tracking the performance of an IRA, holders who find an element of the account that is not performing as expected can easily tweak the allocation. This flexibility makes the IRA a top choice among serious investors.

			</p>
		<h2>Cons to opening an IRA Account</h2>
			<p>
				Limited contribution maximum: An IRA will allow the holder to deposit up to $5,000 if 49 years old or younger; or $6,000 if 50 or older.
				<br>
				<br>
				Low contribution rate: IRAs have a low contribution rate. For those beginning an IRA retirement plan later in life, the contribution rate may not be enough.
				<br>
				<br>
				Penalties for early withdrawal: As with the 401(k), there are penalties for early withdrawal.
				<br>
				<br>
				Required withdrawals at age 70 1/2: Policyholders are also required to begin withdrawing money by 70 1/2 years of age.
